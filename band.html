					<h1>Band</h1>
					<p>Despite sporadic activity in recent years, Sydney’s Green Mohair Suits are ramping it up.  The band has a full album release slated for September 2014 and has just released Aubergine, its second EP this year.</p>
					<p>Brian Campeau and his compatriots Richard Cuthbert, Jason Mannell, and Ben Romalis – a quartet with strong four-part harmonies and love of shenanigans have sidelined the side project tag, and now appear to be allowing Green Mohair Suits to stride ahead as their frontrunner musical outlet.</p>
					<p>Their love of Gram Parsons still close to their flannelette-covered hearts (they started playing in the guise of a Parsons tribute outfit), the band members are the first to admit that the sweeping, expansive clatter and twang they’re pedaling these days pushes their country, folk and bluegrass roots sound.</p>
